# blockchain-electricity-markets
Collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating how blockchain technologies could
be used to improve the design of electricity markets.

## Running the notebooks locally
To run the notebooks locally you will need a working installation of
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) that includes
[IPython](https://ipython.org/), [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/), and
[matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).  Recommended way to satisfy these
requirements is to simply install the
[Anaconda Python 3](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution. To
download the source code you will need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

Once you have installed the required dependencies, clone this repository locally
by opening a terminal window (or Git bash shell on Windows) and run the
following command at the prompt.

`$ git clone https://github.com/KAPSARC/blockchain-electricity-markets.git`

This should download the contents of this repo to your machine. Next just `cd`
into the `blockchain-electricity-markets` directory and run the following
command to start the Jupyter notebook server.

```bash
$ cd blockchain-electricity-markets/
$ jupyter notebook
```

## Running the notebooks in the cloud using Binder
If you don't want to bother downloading  and installing all of the required
dependencies, then you can run then you can run the notebooks in the cloud
using the [Binder](https://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/KAPSARC/blockchain-electricity-markets/master?filepath=index.ipynb)
service (or click on the Binder badge at the top of this file!).
